# Description
Unfortunately, there isn't a way with plain `dotnet test` to automatically rerun failed tests.\
This tool is wrapper for the `dotnet test` that automatically reruns any tests with the outcome "Failed" until they pass or a maximum number of attempts has been reached. This is useful, for cases where tests may fail intermittently due to external factors such as network connectivity, database availability, or race conditions.\
Please note that this tool is language-dependent. The output of `dotnet test` may be localized, and if it is not in English, the tool may not function correctly. Currently, only English is supported.
